How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

1) Very quick availability of only differing parts of code
2) Quick view of what's been replaced in the code
3) Quick view of where are changes localised (line number)
4) Partially well structured/easy to read changed code "snippets" - but that could be done better still


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
1) if i do something that doesn't prove to be a good idea later in time, i can easily revert to version of code where change has not been made yet
2) It enables me to compare functionality of all versions and see the progress (leads to more motivation?)


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Cons
	1) in some cases some work might be lost before new version is added
Pros
	1) no over cluttering with more versions then whats practical
	2) changes are logical and compact


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
1) git is probably made for programmers in mind and its common to work on one project using multiple files - one file changed without another one change
		logically alos doesnt make much sense
2) google docs is probably made just for single file every day office operations, like word etc where files are usually not inter-related


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
1) it enables me to see all commits made and also to choose ones to compare

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
1) i know i can revert to version without it any time
2) i know i can check where exactly in code did i introduce the bug


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
1) i want to start having my app's code versions tracked and described easily using github
2) i want to be able to check changes in code of my app
